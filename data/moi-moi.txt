MOI MOI (BEANS CAKE) 

Moi Moi, so tasty they named it twice. Okay that was a bit corny but I love this dish made from beans/black eyed peas. 

I think it makes an excellent Saturday morning breakfast because it is highly nutritious whilst filling. Serve with custard or if 
throwing a party alongside Jollof rice. 

INGREDIENTS 
Serves 4 
- 500g Beans/Black Eyed Peas. 
- 4 Boiled Eggs (optional) 
- 2 ½ cooking spoons of Palm oil /Vegetable oil 
- Cooked Fish/Sardines 
- ½ Clove Garlic/Ginger 
- 60g Shrimps (optional) 
- Leaves / Sandwich bags / Aluminium cups. 
- 4 Fresh Tomatoes 
- 7 Small Chilli Pepper 
- Maggi/Salt
 
METHOD

STEP 1 Soak the Beans/Black eyed peas for not longer than 30 – 45 minutes, wash and peel off the brown back of the 
beans by rubbing the beans with your palms until it becomes white then wash thoroughly. Be sure to remove all 
the brown peels. 

STEP 2 Wash the beans till all is clean white, add onions, red chilli pepper, tomatoes, chopped small garlic and a bit of 
ginger (very little), blend all together. 

STEP 3 Boil the eggs, shrimps and fish 

STEP 4 Add 2 ½ tablespoon of palm oil or vegetable oil and seasoning like Maggi/salt then stir, taste if seasoning is 
 okay. 

STEP 5 Slice the egg and shred the fish make sure to remove the bones. 

STEP 6 Rinse the leave/sandwich bag/aluminium cups, fold into a cone brake the bottom backward to avoid leakage, 
pour the grounded beans, add few shrimps, fresh sliced eggs and wrap the leave. 

STEP 7 Put water in a cooking pan and add all the wraps inside cover to cook for 30mins. 

STEP 8 Open one wrap to see if cooked and solid. 

Note: Instead of leaves use sandwich bags or aluminium cups. 

Tip: Make aluminium cups by cutting open cans of condensed or evaporated milk. 
Use palm oil instead of Vegetable oil with enough large red peppers to improve the richness and reddishness of Moi Moi, which makes it more appetising.
